# miio-go
An implementation of the miIO home protocol by Xiaomi written in Golang. Heavily inspired by:

 - [The Javascript Implementation](https://github.com/aholstenson/miio)
 - [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/OpenMiHome/mihome-binary-protocol)
 - [API design in this Lifx client implementation (pdx/lifx)](https://github.com/pdf/golifx)

This implementation has been design with the following concerns:
 - Testability
 - Development without a miIO device handy (or performing any real network operations)
 - A simple event-based API.

## Supported Devices
At the moment, only the following devices are officially supported by this library. Feel free to
[submit a pull request](), I'd be more than happy to have more devices supported by this library.

 - Xiaomi Mi Smart WiFi Socket (v1 - no USB)
